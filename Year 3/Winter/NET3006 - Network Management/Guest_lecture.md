# Guest Lecture today


## Guest 1: Martin Sasseville
Currently working at Nokia 

Technical expertise engineer in May 2023

How interviews went:
- Mixed technical interview 
  - Asked interpersonal questions 
  - Tested by showing a wireshark file and asked what was wrong
  - If things aren't going to plan, there is still hope
- Second interview
  - More technical and in depth in regards to MPLS
  - Looked through diagrams

Gonna read mandatory training and then get given time to catch up to tools being used. (Use SalesForce for tickets)

Most of this job is analyzing tech support files as well as going through ticket logs.

Occasionally can learn to write scripts to help solve issues that are found.

Notes:
- Have soft skills
- If you are able to communicate in a clear and concise way, minor mistakes won't bother interviewers


Home assistant - Automate things at your home

Reddit is a good way to get ideas for things to do.

What was done over the past year:

1. HR interview - showcase whether you are the right fit for the company and right person for the team 
   - Dont repeat what you have on your resume, they will have it right next to them (especially for full time)
   - Explicitly talk about internships or projects done
2. Tech assignment - e.g. coding assignments, figuring out the output of the program, reading logs
3. Tech Theory/interpersonal interview
   - In depth questions about technologies you worked with so make sure to understand it
