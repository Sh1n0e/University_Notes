		<p>I have always had an interest in working with any form of computers and modern technology. I decided to take the BIT Net program because the course list contained courses that had all my common interests that being: <i> Coding, Networking, Cyber security, Web programming. </i> </p>
		
		<p> I have always had a passion for learning a <b>bunch of hobbies </b> because I enjoy the satisfaction in knowing a little bit of a lot of things and surprisingly, I have found many uses for a lot of these hobbies I have collected especially when it comes to coding and Web programming. All that being said my defacto main hobby is gaming!</p>
